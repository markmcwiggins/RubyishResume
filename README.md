RubyishResume
=============

Here is almost all data from the resume I sent to SeoMOZ displayed in a pleasing (I hope!) format.

I used Rails version 3.2.8 and Ruby version 1.9.3 (via RVM).

I didn't install any extra gems that the installers for these
packages didn't install.

To run: 

    rails server

then

    http://localhost:3000

will take you to the first page and there are links at the bottom for
navigation to other parts.

Thanks!
